# # HTTP Headers:

# HTTP headers are additional pieces of information sent by a client or a server in the form of key-value pairs within
# an HTTP request or response. These headers provide metadata about the request or response and help facilitate
# communication between the client and the server.

# HTTP headers are located in the header section of an HTTP message and consist of a field name followed by a
# colon and a value. They can convey various types of information, including content type,
# cache control directives, authentication credentials, session information, and more.

# HTTP headers are essential for controlling and managing the behavior of the HTTP protocol.
# They allow clients and servers to exchange information and negotiate various aspects of the HTTP communication,
# such as content negotiation, caching, authentication, and session management.

# There are two main types of HTTP headers:
# Request Headers: These headers are sent by the client as part of an HTTP request to provide information about
# the client or to modify the requested resource's behavior. Examples of request headers include "User-Agent"
# (providing information about the client's software), "Accept" (indicating acceptable content types),
# and "Authorization" (containing authentication credentials).

# Response Headers: These headers are sent by the server as part of an HTTP response to provide additional
# information about the response or to modify the client's behavior. Examples of response headers include
# "Content-Type" (indicating the type of content being sent), "Cache-Control" (controlling caching behavior),
# and "Set-Cookie" (setting cookies in the client's browser).

# HTTP headers play a crucial role in the proper functioning and customization of web communication,
# enabling clients and servers to exchange information and instruct each other on how to handle requests and
# responses effectively.
