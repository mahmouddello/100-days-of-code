# the input function looks pretty much identical for the print function
# instead of the key word "print" it's just the word "input"
input("A prompt for the user") #Prompt = تلميح , identical = متطابقة
# To give the user a hint as what kind of data that we want to input
print("Hello " +input("What is you're name ?"))
