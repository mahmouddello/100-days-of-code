# Instructions :
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#
# https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
#
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
#
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# Code :
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

int_age = int(age)
days = 90 * 365 - int_age * 365
weeks = 90 * 52 - int_age * 52
months = 90 * 12 - int_age * 12

message = f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left."
print(message)
