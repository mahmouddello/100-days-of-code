    "Today was a pretty packed lesson where we introduced a lot of new concepts. In this lesson we looked at how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use nested loops to remove unwanted characters from multiple columns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter Pandas DataFrames based on multiple conditions using both `.loc[]` and `.query()`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create bubble charts using the Seaborn Library\n",
    "\n",
    "* Style Seaborn charts using the pre-built styles and by modifying Matplotlib parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use floor division (i.e., integer division) to convert years to decades\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Seaborn to superimpose a linear regressions over our data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a judgement if our regression is good or bad based on how well the model fits our data and the r-squared metric\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run regressions with scikit-learn and calculate the coefficients.\n",
