Explained how the snake move after adding a new body part :

1 - When the snake gets extended, a new segment is added to the existing list of segments of the snake.
At the start this new segment will have, in fact, the same position as the previous last segment.

2 - Then, the move() method of Snake is called and in the for-loop each segment will move to a new position.
The new segment (which is now the last segment in the list) will not move
(since it will have the same position as the former last segment).
But the former last segment, which is now the second to last segment,
will move to the position of the third to last segment.

3 - So the new segment, which is now the last segment,
will have a different position than the second to last segment (formerly last segment),
which means that they will not appear on top of each other.
