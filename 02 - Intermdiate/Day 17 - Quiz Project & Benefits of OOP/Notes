1- 'pass' Keyword : When we create a class or a function in Python and we dont have anything in the class or the function,
it will give an error because Python expect indentation after creating a class or function; to solve this problem
We use a keyword in Python called 'pass' (Which it means dont mind me now, continue to the next line.)
--------------------------------------
2- PascalCase : Every first letter of a word is Capitalized (ex. CarCamshaftPulley)
3- camelCase : Difference between camelCasing and PascalCase is that first word in camelCasing is all lower case.
4- snake_case : All the words are lower case but they are seperated with a an underscore (snake_game)
---------------------------------------
5- Constructor : It's a part of the blueprint that allows us to specify what should happen when we create an object,
in programming this is also known as "initialize".
5.1- 'self' Keyword: It means the actual object being created and initialised
5.2- Parameters in the (__init__) Constructor : We can add many parameters as we wusg and this parameters gonna be
passed in when an object is created.
5.3 Benefit of the Constructor : More efficient when we create too many objects in the Future.
5.4 Not all attributes should be initialised : Suppose you're creating a new instagram account; the instagram account
has information like username, userid and so on... every instagram account start with 0 followers, imagine if we pass
the followers account of every new account created every single time! it's non sense. The solution for there problem
that we can provide default value in the constructor with every new account created without setting the attribute or
the followers count every time.
